*A DevOps-focused journey into Docker, system orchestration, and infrastructure management.*  

---

## Overview  

The **Inception** project, part of the 1337 School curriculum, introduces students to the principles of containerization, system orchestration, and infrastructure as code. Students learn to design and deploy a multi-service infrastructure using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, with a focus on modularity, scalability, and security.  

---

## Key Objectives  

- Understand containerization and virtualization principles.  
- Use **Docker** to create and manage containers.  
- Orchestrate multiple services with **Docker Compose**.  
- Ensure secure and scalable infrastructure deployment.  
- Implement best practices for DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.  

---

## Features  

- Build custom Docker images for services like **Nginx**, **MariaDB**, and **WordPress**.  
- Use **volumes** for persistent data storage.  
- Configure networks to manage service communication.  
- Enforce service isolation and security through environment variables and user privileges.  
- Automate infrastructure deployment with a single command.  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/mkatfi/Inception.git  
   ```  

2. Navigate to the project directory and start the containers:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up --build  
   ```  

3. Access the deployed services through the configured domain or IP.

## Challenges  

- Designing a scalable and modular containerized infrastructure.  
- Managing service dependencies and secure configurations.  
- Debugging and optimizing Docker containers and networks.
